## About

I'm interested in making digital tools. My approach do building and designing software is technology-angostic and I have built products using web, native, conversational and other technologies

### Work

My current job is building software as a consultant at [esentri](https://esentri.com). I've been there since 2011, first working as a student and then joining the company full-time.

Since I was quite interested in native iOS development I got to build a client application for a project management app. Because there was no real API for other clients I got to build the API as well. It was quite the journey since it was my big product. I learned a lot during that time.

From 2015 to 2016 I helped a larger organization improve their internal JSF Framework. During that time I first started getting into accessibility since it was a big focus for them. It helped me design better overall experiences for the web.

In 2016 I switched products inside the same org and got to build a career counseling app for the web. This was also the first big Single Page Application I got to work on. Complementing the Angular client was a backend using Spring Boot. Building the API I got quite interested in REST architecture style. 

2018 was the year hopped on the React train. A global user administration system for a couple of thousand local subsidiaries was getting a big revamp using React and Spring Boot. The learning curve was quite steep. But the prior experience in Angular helped me get into the new framework. We extended the REST API to support HATEOAS using HAL. It was an interesting experiment, but there were some shortcomings in our implementation.

Since 2019 I'm designing and building another revamp. A 20+-year-old system needed to support new business requirements. These made it necessary to migrate to a new stack, which was determined to be based on Angular and Spring Boot.
