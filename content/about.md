## About

I'm interested in making digital tools. Since I'm focused on building and designing software for humans I'm technology-agnostic. But I also believe in the power the web has.

### Work

My current job is building software as a consultant at [esentri](https://esentri.com). I've been there full-time since 2015.

From 2015 to 2016 I helped a larger organization improve their internal JSF Framework. During that time I first started getting into accessibility since it was a big focus for them. It helped me design better user experiences inside the browser.

In 2016 I switched products inside the same org and got to build a career counseling app for the web. This was also the first big Single Page Application I got to work on. Complementing an Angular client was a server written with Spring Boot.

2018 was the year hopped on the React train. A global user administration system for a couple of thousand local subsidiaries was getting a big revamp using React and Spring Boot. The learning curve was quite steep. But the prior experience in Angular helped me get into the new framework.

Since 2019 I'm designing and building another revamp. A 20+-year-old system needed to support new requirements. These made it necessary to migrate to a new stack containing Angular and Spring Boot.
